Simulator for the whole network activity in *C. elegans*


Novel modifications include finding SVD of the motorneurons for behavioural proxy with additional current injected in the TRNs and investigating the effect of removing this current. In addition the the simulation is included the mechanism for changinh the synaptic equilibrium value, and perturbations into neuronal activity.

Main simulation can be found in simulation_main.m. The script should generate the following figure:
